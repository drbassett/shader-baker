# shader-baker
GLSL shader editor with live preview

## History
The original [`shader-baker`](https://github.com/dboone/shader-baker.git) project was written in C# and WPF. The authors, @drbassett and @dboone, selected WPF because they thought it would be awesome. For certain things, WPF was indeed awesome. However, as the project grew, they found that too much of their time was spent figuring out some obsecure detail of WPF. In the interest of advancing the project, the authors decided that it would be best to use a more familiar language.
